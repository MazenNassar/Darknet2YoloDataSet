# Darknet2YoloDataSet
This is a Python code to convert darknet dataset into yolo datasset

Note: I tested it with yolov8 and it worked, You can get dataset with https://github.com/Trombov/FutureNNAimbot (For aim assist) or official darknet: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet

Just run the python script enter your game's name like in darknet/FutureNNAimbot

Warning: I didn't make the script accept unicode in the game name like : and ; so edit it if you want

And then add the data/img full path

Just Those will convert the darknet dataset into yolo dataset

and if you want to train it(make .pt output file) I have also added a prompt for that
